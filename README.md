** Whate off port**

This Project was to test my skill on APIs and understanding Monte Carlo simulations to make predictions in financial markets. To make an educated argument on which portfolio would be the better option to have an investment with. 

**Data Cleaning**
- Gathered the data needed about the major hedge invesment companies, algorithmic porfolios, and certain stocks that I have choosed on my end. Cleaned the data to concatinate them into the one dataframe to compare the different porfolios together 

**Quanitative analysis**
- compared the data on the portfolios to one another. Compared the _Standard Deviation_ of each portfolio, Calculated the _Cumulative Returns_ of each portfolio, Tied it off with a _Risk Analysis_ of each to see which portfolio carries the most risk with it.
